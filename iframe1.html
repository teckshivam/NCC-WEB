<h1>WHY NCC?</h1>
<p>
The NCC in India was formed with theNational Cadet Corps Act of 1948. It was
raised on 15 July 1948. The origin of NCC can be traced back to the ‘University
Corps‘, which was created under the Indian Defence Act 1917, with the objective to
make up the shortage of the Army.
It is open to school and college students on voluntary basis. National Cadet Corps is
a Tri-Services Organization, comprising the Army, Navy and Air Force, engaged in
grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens. The National
Cadet Corps in India is a voluntary organization which recruits cadets from schools,
colleges and universities all over India. The Cadets are given basic military training
in small arms and parades. The officers and cadets have no liability for active military
service once they complete their course but are given preference over normal
candidates during selections based on the achievements in the corps.
The NCC was given an inter-service image in 1950 when the Air Wing was added,
followed by the Naval Wing in 1952. Same year, the NCC curriculum was extended
to include community development/social service activities as a part of the NCC
syllabus at the behest of Late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who took keen interest in the
growth of the NCC. Following the 1962 Sino-Indian war, to meet the requirement of
the Nation, the NCC training was made compulsory in 1963. In 1968, the Corps was
again made voluntary
